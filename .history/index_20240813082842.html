    <p> <i>HTML stands for <b>HyperText Markup Language.</b> <br>
        It's the standard markup language used to create and design web pages. 
        The current version of HTML being widely used is <b> HTML5.</b> <br>
        HTML5 introduced new features like <b>video, audio, canvas,</b> and more, making it more versatile for modern web development.<br>

        In terms of history, HTML was first created by <b>Tim Berners-Lee in 1991.</b> <br>
         It was originally designed to help scientists share documents. Over the years,<br>
          HTML has evolved significantly to support the growing demands of the internet,<br>
          leading to the development of <b>HTML5</b>, which is the latest version used today.</i></P>
